## Security Considerations

Glato is a security testing tool that:
- Performs authorized security assessments of GitLab environments
- Should only be used on systems you own or have explicit permission to test
- May trigger security alerts in target environments
- Handles sensitive data like tokens and secrets during operation

**Important**: Only use Glato for legitimate security testing purposes.
